“Difficult to make even small changes”

“Breaking functionality of the software by making changes”

“Introducing a new bug by fixing another one”

“Implementing code that is unnecessary”

“Almost impossible to add a new feature because of complicated code”

“The never-shipping product”

“Throwing code away and rewriting it from scratch”
To avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software. You should develop a mindset that every developer should have. This mindset will help you make better decisions in your daily programming journey. You can keep your software as simple as possible. You can protect it from being an unmanageable and complex system.



Here are the key points that every developer must master.
- .1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

Remember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are. 

- .2. The Goals of Software Design
When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things “just work,” and less time focusing on helping users. 

- . 3. (Mis)understanding
Developers who don’t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems

- . 4. Simplicity
Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

- . 5. Complexity
The source of many software failures is complexity. You start out with a simple project that can be completed in one month. Then you add complexity, and the task will take up to three months.

- . 6. Maintenance
Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development. Unfortunately, developers usually ignore how important it is.

- . 7. Consistency
Consistency is a big part of simplicity. If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place. For example, if you name a variable thisIsVariable, then all of your variables should be named that way (otherVariable, anAnotherVariable, etc. not other_variable). – Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity

- . 8. Prioritizing


- .9. Solving Problems

The first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them. Write down your problem and try to explain it to someone else.

- .10. Good enough is fine

Whether creating a new project or adding a feature to existing system developers tend to plan everything out in detail from the beginning.

- .11. Predictions

“A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future. It could be factual and based on some kind of objective data or it could be based on an assumption.”

- .12. Assumptions

- .13. Stop Reinventing
Simple rule:

Don’t reinvent the wheel.

- .14. Resistance
As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.

Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software.


- .15. Automation
Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks. Set them up and forget about them. They can work while you are sleeping. When you realize that you are doing something again and again, just remember this rule:

If you can automate it, automate it.

- .16. Code measurement
I see developers who measure their software quality based on code lines. They think that more code lines mean that they are doing a great job. The software contains hundreds of thousands of lines of code, which means the software they work on is so big.

- .17. Productivity
Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible. The question is not “How can I write more code?” rather it should be “How can I remove more code?”


- .18. Testing
I see many mistakes when it comes to testing code. Let me give you an example. There were two conditions, a simple if-else block. The developer gave input to the software which will enter inside the if block. They tested it and committed code to source control. Done!

- .19. (Under)Estimation
- .20. Running Away From Rewriting
- .21. Documentation and Commenting
One of the common misconceptions about commenting is that developers add comments that say what code is doing. This is wrong. That should be obvious from reading the code. If it’s not obvious, it means that it is not readable and it should be made simpler.

- .22. Picking Technologies
- .23. Self-Development
Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.

Be open-minded. Don’t be obsessive about one technology. Use the required technology to solve a specific problem. Don’t be in the unnecessary discussion like Microsoft vs Linux :)

- .25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
